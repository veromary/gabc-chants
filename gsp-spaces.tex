%This count tells gregoriotex what \gre@factor the below values correspond to.
%% All the following values correspond to a gre@factor of 17.  At this size the scores should be approximately the size usually seen in a gradual.
%% If youâ€™re creating your own space configuration file, you may set this to some other value, should you so desire.
\greconffactor=16%

%How thick the lines should be.  When set equal to \greconffactor (above) the staff lines will be their default thickness.  Larger numbers result in thicker lines.

%the space above the lines
\grechangedim{spaceabovelines}{0 cm}{scalable}%
% this counter is the threshold above which we start accounting notes above
% lines for additional space above lines. For instance with a threshold of
% 2 and a staff of 4 lines, notes with a pitch of k and l will not interfere
% with the space above lines
\grechangecount{additionaltopspacethreshold}{2}%
% same, for notes taken into account for alt text vertical position

%the space between the lines and the bottom of the text Changed
\grechangedim{spacelinestext}{0.5 cm}{scalable}%
%the per-note additional space between lines and the bottom of the text
\grechangedim{noteadditionalspacelinestext}{0.14413 cm}{scalable}%
% this counter is the number of low notes which will add on the
% noteadditionalspacelinestext.  For instance, with a threshold of 2, every
% note below c will add noteadditionalspacelinestext space for each pitch needed
% below c, accounting for the various signs.

%the space beneath the text
\grechangedim{spacebeneathtext}{0 cm}{scalable}%
% height of the text above the note line
\grechangedim{abovelinestextraise}{-0.1 cm}{scalable}%
% height that is added at the top of the lines if there is text above the lines (it must be bigger than the text for it to be taken into consideration)
\grechangedim{abovelinestextheight}{0.3 cm}{scalable}%
